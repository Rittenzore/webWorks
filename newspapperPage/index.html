      <h5 class="text-center" style="font-size: 24px;font-weight:500; line-height:1.6" ><strong>The Downtown <br> Neighbors Alliance</strong></h5>
      <p style="font-size:13px; line-height:1.6">Leading the only independent citizens’
organization in downtown Miami entails, for
starters, juggling a full-time job—as a
volunteer—with the day job we all have, plus
family and social obligations. At the risk of
sounding dramatic, taking a minute to ponder
our thriving community is a real—and yet
necessary—luxury. Necessary because
otherwise we are condemned to be reactive,
and there’s plenty to react to, but we need
also to think about leadership.</p>


<p class="font-weight-bolder"  style="color:#5279a6;line-height:1.6">"An apt definition for the DNA is that
of clearinghouse for the myriad issues
thirty-thousand residents face in a
fast-changing neighborhood."</p>

<p class="m-0" style="font-size:13px;text-indent: 20px;line-height:1.6 ">
To name just some of these issues: street
signage, lights not working in the parks
where residents walk their dogs after work,
street closures, criminals hiding behind the
appearance of the bona fide homeless, unruly
boats disrupting the night with noise,
policing and creating media awareness.
Accordingly, we have the protagonists—be
they a new Police Commander or
representatives from the Signature Bridge
and Formula 1, come and address these
issues before our residents.</p>
 <p class="m-0" style="font-size:13px;text-indent: 20px;line-height:1.6 "> Another colorful definition is that of a
watchdog. We keep a vigilant eye on our
elected officials whose ethics are relentlessly
targeted by armies of highly paid lobbyists,
and we have proposed and promoted
legislation. The DNA has appeared before
the Miami City Commission multiple times.
Often, these appearances are all-day affairs,
after long hours outside under precarious
weather conditions. Why? Because the future
of our parks, our schools, the safety of
pedestrians, cyclists and motorists, and our
public health are all at stake. The level of
noise pollution, for example, causes
permanent hearing damage, and if we don’t
intervene, physically, intellectually and
monetarily, with thousands of dollars in legal
fees, we are bound to end up half deaf and
with our real estate depreciated.</p>
  <p class="m-0" style="font-size:13px;text-indent: 20px;line-height:1.55 ">But the job also includes the promotion of
exciting social and cultural events, like Opera
in the park and Shakespeare for children, or
refitting a street for social gatherings and
partnering with other cultural organizations
to present forums and salons that foster a
sense of neighborhood. We are actively
involved in creating the kind of civil society
that effective democracies depend on to
thrive.</p>
  <p class="m-0" style="font-size:13px;text-indent: 20px;line-height:1.55">As Margaret Mead remarked: “Never doubt
that a small group of thoughtful, committed
citizens cans change the world; indeed, it’s
the only thing that ever has.”

      <p class="text-center mt-2" style="margin-bottom: 0">Cover Story I <strong> Raul Guerrero </strong></p>
      <h1 style="font-weight:500">Miami Worldcenter</h1>
      <p class="m-0" align="justify" style="font-size:13px;text-indent: 20px;  ">The Miami Worldcenter engulfs ten blocks between NE 2nd and North Miami
Avenues, and from 6th to 11th Streets. The 27-acre spread—a mini-city within
downtown’s Park West neighborhood—includes the old Arena, where the
Marriot Marquis will build a convention center. </p>
     <p class="m-0" align="justify" style="font-size:13px;text-indent: 20px;  ">It’s comparable to the Hudson Yards, the mammoth development in New
York City, suggests Nitin Motwani, the development group’s managing
principal. He adds that it may well transform the way we experience Miami:
“This is a city that unfortunately is not known for its parks and public spaces but
has the weather that we do. We hope that people will start to appreciate the
outside in a way they didn’t have the opportunity to do before.”
Downtown NEWS met with Mr. Motwani at the just-completed Caoba
Tower, a luxury 46-story rental along what used to be a derelict 7th street, now a
pedestrian promenade. The Caoba edges closer to completion of the project’s
first phase, which includes the opening later this year of the Paramount
condominium tower.</p>
 <p class="m-0" align="justify" style="font-size:13px;text-indent: 20px;  ">This is no insignificant feat, considering the myriad challenges a project of
this magnitude had to overcome: economic turbulence, lawsuits, regulations,
deals falling through (Bloomingdale’s), workforce (to keep the workforce local,
MWC trained many people from the surrounding area, especially Overtown)
and, of course, this being Biscayne Bay territory, a hurricane.
Brief History</p> <p class="" align="justify" style="font-size:13px;text-indent: 20px;  ">
Around 2004, Nitin Motwani’s partners started purchasing empty parcels in city
auctions and from over one hundred private individuals. People thought the idea
crazy. Even 4 years ago, when he presented the concept to the public, more than
a few attendees rolled their eyes and whispered adjectives like “quixotic.”
Camillus House used to be there, catering to a large homeless and transient
population that occupied the abandoned buildings and empty lots. The area had
been, observed Dr. Paul George, Miami’s historian par excellence, “a mix of
homes, apartments, businesses, and warehouses that fell on very hard times by
the 1960s and 70s.”</p ><h5 align="left" class="font-weight-bold mb-1">Brief History</h5>

<h5 class="text-center" style="font-size: 24px;font-weight:500; line-height:1.6" ><strong>Pedestrians vs. <br> Motorists</strong></h5>
<p style=" margin-bottom: 0rem; font-size:13px; text-indent: 20px; line-height:1.6">
  Considering the number of commuters, and
the growing number of people calling
downtown home, fighting for the right to
downtown streets was bound to get deadly. To
tell a pedestrian, “Run for your life!” at
certain intersections would not be hyperbole.
“I almost got hit by a car,” is a common
complaint aired to the Downtown Neighbors
Alliance.</p> <p style="margin-bottom:0rem; font-size:13px; text-indent: 20px; line-height:1.6">Many do get hit by cars and take their
complaints to the grave. Not for nothing,
Miami ranks high among the places most
dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists.
“Miami is auto-centric, and we all know about
Miami’s drivers,” says Steven Herzberg, a
young attorney who heads the DNA’s Traffic
and Pedestrian Safety Committee. People
from all over the world converge downtown,
all retaining driving habits from their mother
countries (father country, if you are German).
Add to that street signage designed decades
ago, before downtown’s current, thriving
incarnation.</p> <p style="margin-bottom:0rem; font-size:13px; text-indent: 20px; line-height:1.6">A clarification: In the war between
pedestrians and motorists, the former are not
innocent victims. Downtown pedestrians are
often seen snaking dangerously through heavy
traffic, their jaywalkers’ eyes glued to
smartphones.</p><h5 align="left" class="font-weight-bold mb-1">Predominantly Young</h5>
<p style="font-size:13px; text-indent: 20px; line-height:1.6">Millennials have a predilection for walking,
skating or biking back and forth between work
and play. My neighbor’s accountant, for
example, sporting a bow tie—he’s a
traditionalist in that sense—skates down and
across Brickell Bridge to his firm.
